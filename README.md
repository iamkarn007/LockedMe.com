Creating Phase 1 Project for Simpli Learn (Features: Add files, delete File, Search File and View Files)

LockedMe.com is a file management application developed by Ayush Karn for Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. The project aims to create a prototype for digitizing file management operations. The application allows users to perform basic file operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and displaying files within a specified directory.

## Key Features
Display Files: Users can view the list of files in the selected directory. The files are displayed in alphabetical order for easy navigation and reference.
1. Add Files: Users can add new files to the directory. The application validates the file name for invalid characters and ensures that duplicate file names are not counted.


2. Delete Files: Users can remove files from the directory. The application prompts for the file name validates its existence and deletes it from the file system. The updated file list is then displayed.


3. Search Files: Users can search for files within the directory. The application prompts for a file name and checks its presence in the file system. If found, the application informs the user about the file's existence.
